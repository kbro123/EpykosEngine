# EpykosEngine — Decision log

Append-only. Superseding a decision adds a new entry that names the one it replaces.

## D1 — No JIT (2026-09-22)
Kernels are pre-compiled engine code driven by data: a build-time catalogue (AOT code generation) plus a tiled
interpreter. Rationale: portability (x86 + ARM), no runtime compiler dependency, deterministic builds.
Revisit only if M1/M3 show the catalogue + interpreter cannot reach the gates.

## D2 — Standalone repository (2026-09-22)
No code or build dependency on SwapEngine. The correctness oracle is the engine's own templated-`double` path;
cross-checks against SwapEngine and QuantLib are added later as test-only dependencies.

## D3 — Maths is written once, templated on `Scalar` (2026-09-22)
The same template is the reference (`double`) and the recording source (`Rec`). No hand-written derivative code and
no hand-written per-product kernels on the hot path.

## D4 — Domains are inferred, not declared (2026-09-22)
The signature pass is authoritative. Scope markers in templates are optional hints that the pass verifies.

## D5 — `select` is the default for value branches (2026-09-22)
Both arms computed; mask, margin and arm gap exported. Guards remain only as a safety net for unconverted branches.
Flips are classified by arm gap, never by the predicate bit alone.

## D6 — Quote-dependent transforms stay outside the pricing graph (2026-09-22)
Bands, log/zero-coupon row maps depend on the live quote: they are `row_map`s at the graph edge, and their active sets
belong to the solver (`pin`).

## D7 — Solvers are `implicit` nodes, never unrolled (2026-09-22)
Tape length must not depend on iteration count; derivatives must not depend on the solver's path.

## D8 — Every rewrite declares an exactness class (2026-09-22)
E0 bit-identical, E1 ≤ 1 ulp per op. Gates apply the matching tolerance. Bit-identity gates build the reference
with `-ffp-contract=off`. No `-ffast-math`.

## D9 — Performance is gated against ourselves (2026-09-22)
Per machine+toolchain fingerprint: fail on > 1.25× self-regression or on an absolute target miss. External references
(QuantLib, hand-fused kernels, other engines) are informational tables, never the gate. No cross-fingerprint
comparisons.

## D10 — Verification precedes the compiler (2026-09-22)
The round-trip identity check and the differential tester land with the first pass that needs them, not after.
